Yamaha Network Receivers
=========

About
-----
This is a plugin for [EventGhost] which allows you to control your Yamaha AV Receivers over the internet (local network). It should work with most/all Yamaha RX-Vxxx models which contain either an ethernet connection or a wireless connection.  The computer running [EventGhost] should be on the same local network, or you will need to use port forwarding.

Tested Models:
------
```
RX-V867
RX-V473
RX-V775
```

Supported Models (Incomplete):

Typically, any Yamaha RX-Vxxx models are supported. Here is an incomplete list of (possibly) supported models.
