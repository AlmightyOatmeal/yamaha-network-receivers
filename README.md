NOTICE:

config.ini:

The plugin will attempt to locate your network receiver automatically. If the program is unable to locate it, or you have multiple receivers, you will have to open it up and modify the settings yourself.

ip_address: Use this option to set a manual ip address. you should only do this if you have a static one.

auto_detect_model: Use this option to set the model of your reciever. Only use this if you have multiple network receivers, and want to specify which one to control.
